# Cloud Native Basel - Code of Conduct

Cloud Native Basel is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and inclusive environment for all community members. We believe in fostering a positive and respectful atmosphere where everyone can freely express their ideas, learn from each other, and build meaningful connections. To ensure the best experience for all participants, we have established the following Code of Conduct:

## Be Kind and Respectful

Treat everyone with kindness, respect, and empathy. Be considerate of others' backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We embrace diversity and value the contributions of individuals from all walks of life. Let's create an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome and comfortable to participate.

## Foster Collaboration and Learning

Our community thrives on collaboration and learning. Engage in constructive discussions, share your knowledge, and be open to new ideas. Encourage and support fellow community members in their cloud native journeys. Together, we can grow and inspire each other.

## Maintain a Positive Environment

Keep the atmosphere positive and uplifting. Avoid derogatory, offensive, or discriminatory language, gestures, or behavior. We are here to create an enjoyable experience for everyone involved. Any form of harassment, intimidation, or disrespectful conduct will not be tolerated.

## Respect Personal Boundaries

Always ask for consent and respect personal boundaries when interacting with others. Be mindful of individual comfort levels when engaging in discussions or social interactions. Remember, everyone has the right to participate without feeling pressured or uncomfortable.

## Avoid Commercial Activities

Cloud Native Basel is intended to have a "by the community for the community" character. As such, it is not a platform for selling products or engaging in overly commercial activities. We encourage a focus on knowledge sharing, collaboration, and building strong community connections.
