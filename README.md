# Cloud Native Basel infos

Welcome to the Cloud Native Basel infos repository! This repository serves as a central hub for all the information related to the Cloud Native Basel platform, which organizes meetups and serves as a community hub for cloud native enthusiasts in the Basel area.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to store, archive, and persist all the essential information about our meetups, including details about upcoming events, call for speakers, and other relevant announcements. It acts as a comprehensive resource for both the organizing team and community members.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into different folders based on the specific information categories. Currently, we have the following structure:

```
infos/
├── call-for-speakers/
│ ├── event1`-cfs.md
│ ├── event2-cfs.md
│ └── ...
├── meetup-guidelines.md
├── resources/
│ ├── presentation-tips.md
│ └── ...
└── ...
```

- The `call-for-speakers` folder contains individual markdown files for each upcoming meetup/event. These files provide all the necessary information for potential speakers, including the event date, theme, submission guidelines, and any specific requirements.

- The `meetup-guidelines.md` file outlines the general guidelines, expectations, and best practices for attendees, speakers, and organizers of our Cloud Native Basel meetups.

- The `resources` folder contains additional resources that can be useful for both speakers and attendees, such as presentation tips, recommended tools, and other relevant materials.
