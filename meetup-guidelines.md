# Cloud Native Basel - Meetup Guidelines

Welcome to the Cloud Native Basel Meetup! We're excited to have you join our vibrant community. To ensure that our meetups are enjoyable and beneficial for everyone, we have established the following guidelines:

## Be Respectful and Inclusive

Respect the diversity of opinions, backgrounds, and experiences of all participants. Treat others with kindness and create a welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and included. Avoid offensive or discriminatory language or behavior. Let's celebrate our differences and foster a sense of belonging for all community members.

## Engage in Meaningful Discussions

Participate actively and contribute constructively to discussions during the meetup. Share your knowledge, insights, and experiences while being attentive to others. Listen attentively and show interest in different perspectives. We encourage open-mindedness and a willingness to learn from one another.

## Embrace the Learning Experience

Our meetups are opportunities to learn, explore, and grow. Be open to new ideas, technologies, and concepts. Ask questions, seek clarification, and engage in thoughtful conversations. Together, we can expand our understanding of cloud native technologies and practices.

## Be Mindful of Time and Schedules

Please arrive on time for the meetup and adhere to the designated schedule. We value your time and that of others. If you're unable to attend an event after RSVPing, kindly update your RSVP status to allow others on the waiting list to attend. Promptness and consideration contribute to the smooth running of our meetups.

## Follow the Organizer's Instructions

Follow the instructions and guidelines provided by the meetup organizers and hosts. They are dedicated to creating a positive and seamless experience for everyone. If you have any questions or concerns during the meetup, don't hesitate to reach out to the organizers for assistance.

## Avoid Commercial Activities

Cloud Native Basel meetups are intended to have a "by the community for the community" character. As such, they are not platforms for selling products or engaging in overly commercial activities. We encourage a focus on knowledge sharing, collaboration, and building strong community connections.

## Have Fun and Connect

Enjoy yourself at our meetups! Take the opportunity to network, make new connections, and engage with fellow cloud native enthusiasts. Share your experiences, challenges, and successes. Building a strong community and fostering connections is an essential part of Cloud Native Basel.

Remember, the success of our meetups depends on the active participation and cooperation of all attendees. Let's create an environment where we can learn, collaborate, and support each other in our cloud native journeys.

If you have any suggestions, feedback, or concerns related to our meetups or these guidelines, please reach out to the organizing team. We appreciate your involvement and look forward to meeting you at our next Cloud Native Basel meetup!"
