# Cloud Native terminology

Here are definitions for each item in the alphabetical list of Cloud Native terms:

- Auto Scaling: Capability to automatically adjust the number of resources based on workload demands.

- Blue-Green Deployment: Technique where two identical environments (blue and green) are used for deployment to minimize downtime during updates.

- CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery): Practices and tools for automating the build, test, and deployment of applications.

- Cloud Native: Refers to an approach to software development and deployment that leverages cloud computing technologies and principles.

- Cloud Native Databases: Databases designed and optimized for deployment and management in cloud-native environments.

- Cloud Native Governance: Practices and policies to ensure compliance, security, and accountability in cloud-native environments.

- Cloud Native Networking: Networking architecture and tools designed to support cloud-native environments, enabling scalability and resiliency.

- Cloud Native Security: Set of practices and tools to ensure the security and compliance of cloud-native applications and infrastructure.

- Cloud-Native Infrastructure: Infrastructure components, such as networking, storage, and compute resources, designed for cloud-native environments.

- Cloud-Native Testing: Approaches and tools for testing cloud-native applications, including container-based testing and chaos engineering.

- CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation): A vendor-neutral organization that hosts and promotes open-source cloud-native projects.

- Containers: Lightweight, isolated runtime environments that package applications and their dependencies for consistent and efficient deployment.

- DevOps: Cultural and technical approach that combines development and operations teams to automate software delivery processes.

- Elasticity: Ability to automatically scale resources up or down based on workload demands.

- Event-Driven Architecture: Approach where applications respond to and emit events as the primary means of communication and coordination.

- FaaS (Function as a Service): A serverless compute offering that enables running individual functions in the cloud.

- Hybrid Cloud: Environment that combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

- Immutable Infrastructure: Infrastructure that is treated as disposable and replaced rather than updated or modified.

- Infrastructure as Code: Practice of managing infrastructure resources through declarative configuration files.

- Kubernetes: An open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- Microservices: Architectural style where applications are composed of small, loosely coupled services that can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled.

- Observability: Ability to gain insight into the behavior and performance of distributed systems through monitoring, logging, and tracing.

- Orchestration: Automated coordination and management of multiple components, such as containers, in a cloud environment.

- Polyglot Persistence: Using different types of databases or data storage technologies within an application to fit specific data needs.

- Scalability: Ability of a system to handle increased workload by adding resources without affecting performance.

- Service Discovery: Mechanism for locating and connecting to available services in a dynamic, distributed system.

- Service Mesh: Infrastructure layer that provides advanced networking, observability, and security features for microservices communication.

- Sidecar Pattern: Design pattern where a separate component runs alongside a primary service to provide additional functionality.

- Serverless Computing: Model where cloud providers manage infrastructure resources, allowing developers to focus on writing and deploying code.

- Zero Trust Security: Security model that assumes no trust by default, requiring authentication and verification for all interactions.
